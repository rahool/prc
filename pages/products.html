          <h4>Jumpstart to the next level!</h4>        
          <p>
Turbo kits can take the performance of your petrol / diesel car to the next level. Turbo kits are a popular way to improve engine performance for all types of vehicles because a turbo can significantly boost an engine’s horsepower without adding a tremendous amount of weight. This forced-induction system compresses the air-flow into the engine so the engine can force more air into a cylinder. Pushing more air into the cylinders allows for more fuel to be added and as a result more power for each explosion within the cylinders. A turbocharged engine produces more power and can improve the engines power-to- weight ratio. Addon Turbo kits can Increase the horsepower of a stock engine by 80%.
